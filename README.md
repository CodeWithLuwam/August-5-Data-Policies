# August-5-Data-Policies

**Activity** <br>

At DXC Tech, you've noticed that many asset records are created not just through the UI, but also through import sets or external integrations. However, when the asset being recovered is a laptop, it's critical to ensure a serial number is always provided, regardless of how the data enters the system. <br>

To enforce this across all entry methods, you've been asked to implement a Data Policy that ensures laptops always have a valid serial number, urgency and employee even if the data comes in via an integration or spreadsheet import.<br>

**Task**: <br>
**Create a New Data Policy** <br>
- Apply to all data types
- Save <br>

**Add Data Policy Rules** <br>

Make sure the following fields are mandatory:
- laptop serial number
- Urgency
- employee
